## 1. Parsing data 

Get Total Market Cap of cryptocurrencies and specific coin's last price using API of web site. 
(total market cap from https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ web page / coin real time price with using Bittrex API)

Load the data with interval of 5 seconds using apscheduler. (https://github.com/agronholm/apscheduler/)

## 2. Telegram Bot

Made simple telegram bot to communicate using Telepot library. (http://telepot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
so, you can search @CoinStatus_bot in Telegram. ( it response when I operating program so, usually it is not enabled)
